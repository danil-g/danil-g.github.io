Hacker and bug bounty hunter.

### More Information

I enjoy challenging myself, assessing and breaking into information systems. I love to learn new things, and engage in understanding emerging technologies. Last year and a half I have been participating in the bug bounty programs and doing penetration testing consulting gigs. I also acquired an interest in markets and investing after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and began trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2012.
